# zhcode
`zhcode` is a Python library designed to facilitate coding in Chinese. It's main purpose is to advance certain programming languages by transforming them into esoteric forms through the Chinese language.

## Python
Currently, basic Python 3 functions are supported. The project is still in the process of translating library keywords, names, and functions into Chinese equivalents. In general, the syntax for coding in 
中文Python is the same as that of normal Python, simply with variables switched. However, several syntactic additions have been made: the dot delimeter `.` in standard Python has been changed to `·`, and 
variables should be enclosed with `「」` to facilitate easier differentiation.

Furthermore, Chinese keyboard characters often have a tendency to include extra space as part of the character—-thus oftentimes reducing the need for extra whitespace after the character. In particular,
variable delimeters. Thus, there is no need to add an extra space after a closing variable delimeter (`」`)--the translator will add one automatically.
